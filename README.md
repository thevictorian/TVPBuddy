# TVPBuddy
A small software app for manipulating the TrafficViewerPro UI for rapid review of .tvp files

There is one instruction: edit the path of the TrafficViewerPro executable in line 218 of the TVPBuddy source file (version6) to suit your TrafficViewerPro installation path. You will need AutoIT installed. I will attach a compiled version soon.
