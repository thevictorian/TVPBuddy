# TVPBuddy
A small software app for manipulating the TrafficViewerPro UI for rapid review of .tvp files

There is one instruction: edit the path of the TrafficViewerPro executable in the TVPBuddy source file (version6) to your TrafficViewerPro installation path. You will need AutoIT installed. I will attach a compiled version soon.

AutoIT: https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/
TrafficViewerPro: https://www.vehiclecounts.com/trafficviewerpro
